The main idea is that this is a selling strategy amound random stocks. It has a very unrealtic stock growth model, it assumes that there's an equal chance of moving upward some amount, as there is down the same amount. Given this behavior, is there a sellpoint that once a stock dips to that level is sold that makes the highest expectation value?
